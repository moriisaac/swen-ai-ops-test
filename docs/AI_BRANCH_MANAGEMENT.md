# AI Branch Management System - Strict 5 Branch Limit

## üö® Problem Solved
The AI engine was creating excessive Git branches (594+ branches), causing:
- Changes to disappear when Git switched to new branches
- Repository bloat and performance issues
- Difficulty tracking actual changes vs AI recommendations
- Loss of work due to branch switching

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Strict Branch Limit: Maximum 5 Branches
- **Hard Limit**: AI engine cannot create more than 5 branches
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Oldest branches are automatically deleted when limit is reached
- **Alert System**: Warnings when branches are unresolved for more than 24 hours

### 2. AI Branch Manager (`ops/ai_branch_manager.py`)
- **Core Functionality**: Enforces strict 5-branch limit
- **Age Monitoring**: Tracks branch age and alerts for unresolved branches
- **Safe Creation**: Only allows new branches when under limit
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes oldest branches when limit exceeded

### 3. AI Engine Integration (`ai-engine/engine.py`)
- **Branch Manager Integration**: Uses branch manager for all branch operations
- **Pre-creation Checks**: Validates branch limit before creating new branches
- **Graceful Failure**: Skips infrastructure updates if branch limit reached
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Triggers cleanup when needed

### 4. Monitoring Script (`ops/monitor_ai_branches.sh`)
- **Regular Monitoring**: Can be run every 2 minutes via cron
- **Real-time Alerts**: Notifies when branch limit reached
- **Age Tracking**: Identifies branches older than 24 hours
- **Status Reporting**: Provides clear health status

## üîß Key Features

### Branch Limit Enforcement
```python
def can_create_branch(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
    """Check if a new branch can be created."""
    branches = self.get_ai_branches()
    count = len(branches)
    
    if count >= self.max_branches:  # 5 branches max
        return False, f"Branch limit reached: {count}/{self.max_branches} branches"
    
    # Check for old unresolved branches
    alerts = self.check_for_alerts()
    if alerts:
        return False, f"Cannot create new branch: {len(alerts)} unresolved branches need attention"
    
    return True, "OK"
```

### Automatic Cleanup
```python
def enforce_branch_limit(self) -> Dict:
    """Enforce strict branch limit of 5 branches maximum."""
    branches = self.get_ai_branches()
    count = len(branches)
    
    if count > self.max_branches:
        # Sort by creation date (newest first)
        branch_details.sort(key=lambda x: x['created_date'], reverse=True)
        
        # Keep only the most recent branches
        branches_to_keep = branch_details[:self.max_branches]
        branches_to_delete = branch_details[self.max_branches:]
        
        # Delete excess branches
        for branch in branches_to_delete:
            subprocess.run(["git", "branch", "-D", branch['name']], check=True)
```

### AI Engine Protection
```python
def update_infrastructure(self, service: str, provider: str, decision: dict) -> bool:
    """Update infrastructure configuration via GitOps with strict branch management."""
    # Check if we can create a new branch using branch manager
    if self.branch_manager:
        can_create, reason = self.branch_manager.can_create_branch()
        if not can_create:
            logger.warning(f"‚ùå Cannot create branch for {service}: {reason}")
            return False
        
        # Create branch safely
        success, branch_name = self.branch_manager.create_branch_safely(service)
        if not success:
            return False
```

## üìä Current Status
- **Branches**: 5 (down from 594+)
- **Health Status**: HEALTHY
- **Monitoring**: Active
- **AI Engine**: Protected against excessive branch creation
- **Alert System**: Active for unresolved branches

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Manual Branch Management
```bash
# Check current status and enforce limits
python ops/ai_branch_manager.py

# Run monitoring script
./ops/monitor_ai_branches.sh
```

### Automated Monitoring (Cron Job)
```bash
# Add to crontab to run every 2 minutes
*/2 * * * * /Users/Mori/Desktop/Work/swen-ai/swen-aio-test/ops/monitor_ai_branches.sh
```

### AI Engine Operation
The AI engine now automatically:
1. **Checks branch limit** before creating new branches
2. **Skips infrastructure updates** if limit is exceeded
3. **Performs automatic cleanup** when threshold is reached
4. **Logs all branch management actions**
5. **Prevents branch creation** if unresolved branches exist

## üéØ Benefits

### Immediate Benefits
- **Prevents Repository Bloat**: Maximum 5 AI branches at any time
- **Preserves Changes**: No more disappearing changes due to branch switching
- **Automated Management**: Self-healing branch cleanup
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboard shows current status
- **Alert System**: Warnings before critical limits are reached

### Long-term Benefits
- **Stable Development Environment**: Predictable branch count
- **Audit Trail**: Detailed logging of all branch operations
- **Performance**: Faster Git operations with fewer branches
- **Reliability**: AI engine operates within safe parameters
- **Maintainability**: Clear branch lifecycle management

## üìà Monitoring Metrics

### Branch Health Metrics
- Total branch count (target: ‚â§5)
- Branch age distribution
- Unresolved branch count
- Cleanup actions taken
- AI engine decision impact

### Alert Conditions
- **Branch Limit Reached**: 5 branches exist
- **Unresolved Branches**: Branches older than 24 hours
- **AI Engine Blocked**: Cannot create new branches
- **Cleanup Required**: Automatic cleanup triggered

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- **Email/Slack Notifications**: For critical alerts
- **Branch Age Policies**: Configurable age thresholds

2. **Age Monitoring**: Alerts for branches older than 24 hours
3. **Graceful Degradation**: AI engine continues operating even when blocked
4. **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for review
5. **Rollback Capability**: Can restore deleted branches if needed

### Error Handling
- **Branch Creation Failure**: Graceful fallback to local changes
- **Cleanup Errors**: Continues operation even if cleanup fails
- **Network Issues**: Works offline, syncs when possible
- **Permission Errors**: Logs errors and continues operation
