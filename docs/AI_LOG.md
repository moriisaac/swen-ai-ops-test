## AI in Production (The Platform Itself)

### AI Engine Components

**1. Cost Optimization Model**

**Type:** Rule-based + ML hybrid  
**Algorithm:** Weighted scoring with historical learning

```python
# Core decision logic
def make_decision(self, service: str, metrics: dict):
    # Rule-based scoring
    scores = self.calculate_scores(metrics)
    
    # ML enhancement (future)
    # if self.ml_model:
    #     scores = self.ml_model.adjust_scores(scores, historical_data)
    
    # Select best option
    best_provider = max(scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['total'])[0]
    return best_provider, decision_metadata
```

**Training Data:**
- Simulated telemetry (development)
- Real telemetry (production)
- Historical cost data
- Performance metrics

**Model Performance:**
- Accuracy: Target 85%+
- Confidence: Reported with each decision
- Explainability: Human-readable explanations

**2. Anomaly Detection**

**Purpose:** Detect unusual cost or performance patterns  
**Method:** Statistical analysis + thresholds

```python
def detect_anomaly(current_value, historical_mean, std_dev):
    z_score = (current_value - historical_mean) / std_dev
    return abs(z_score) > 3  # 3-sigma rule
```

**3. Predictive Forecasting**

**Purpose:** Forecast monthly costs  
**Method:** Time series analysis

```python
forecast = (current_spend / days_elapsed) * days_in_month
trend_factor = recent_7d_avg / previous_7d_avg
adjusted_forecast = forecast * trend_factor
```

---

## Explainability in Production

### Decision Transparency

Every AI decision includes:

1. **Explanation Text:**
   ```
   "Recommended moving service1 from aws to alibaba due to 
    better cost/performance (score: 0.92). AWS cost: $1.30/hr, 
    Alibaba cost: $0.85/hr. Latency difference: 15ms. 
    Predicted monthly savings: $328."
   ```

2. **Score Breakdown:**
   ```json
   {
     "aws": {
       "total": 0.78,
       "cost": 0.65,
       "latency": 0.85,
       "credits": 0.80,
       "gpu": 0.90
     },
     "alibaba": {
       "total": 0.92,
       "cost": 0.95,
       "latency": 0.82,
       "credits": 0.98,
       "gpu": 0.75
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Confidence Score:**
   - Based on data quality, historical accuracy, and metric consistency
   - Range: 0.0 to 1.0
   - Threshold for auto-approval: 0.85

4. **Alternative Options:**
   - Shows why other providers were not selected
   - Helps humans understand trade-offs

### Dashboard Visualization

The dashboard displays:
- Current AI decision confidence
- Historical decision accuracy
- Cost savings achieved vs. predicted
- Decision timeline and reasoning

### Example: Implementing Policy Gate

**Human Input:**
```
"Need a policy gate that evaluates AI recommendations 
against approval criteria"
```

**AI Suggestion (ChatGPT):**
```python
class PolicyGate:
    def evaluate(self, metadata):
        # Check cost delta
        if metadata['cost_delta'] > 0.05:
            return False, "Cost delta too high"
        
        # Check confidence
        if metadata['confidence'] < 0.85:
            return False, "Low confidence"
        
        # ... more checks
        return True, "Approved"
```

**Human Refinement:**
- Added stateful service check
- Implemented traffic impact threshold
- Enhanced error handling
- Added comprehensive logging

**Final Result:**
