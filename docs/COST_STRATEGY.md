## 2. Budget Management

### 2.1 Budget Allocation

| Category | Monthly Budget | Annual Budget | % of Total |
|----------|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Compute | $6,000 | $72,000 | 60% |
| Storage | $2,000 | $24,000 | 20% |
| Network | $1,000 | $12,000 | 10% |
| Other | $1,000 | $12,000 | 10% |
| **Total** | **$10,000** | **$120,000** | **100%** |

### 2.2 Budget Thresholds & Actions

```
$0 ────────────────────────────────────────────── $12,000
│         │              │              │              │
│    Normal (80%)   Warning (90%)  Critical (100%)  Hard Limit (120%)
│         │              │              │              │
│    $8,000         $9,000        $10,000        $12,000
│         │              │              │              │
│    Monitor        Alert          Freeze         Block
```

#### Actions by Threshold

**Normal (< 80%):** 
- Continue operations
- Weekly cost review

**Warning (80-90%):**
- Daily monitoring
- Alert FinOps team
- Review optimization opportunities

**Critical (90-100%):**
- Freeze non-essential deployments
- Immediate cost review meeting
- Accelerate optimization initiatives

**Hard Limit (> 100%):**
- Block new resource creation
- Emergency cost reduction plan
- Executive escalation

### 2.3 Budget Forecasting

```python
# Monthly forecast formula
forecast = (current_spend / days_elapsed) * days_in_month

# With trend adjustment
trend_factor = recent_7d_avg / previous_7d_avg
adjusted_forecast = forecast * trend_factor
```

## 4. AI-Driven Cost Optimization

### 4.1 Optimization Algorithm

```python
def calculate_cost_score(provider_metrics):
    """
    Weighted scoring for cost optimization
    """
    weights = {
        'cost': 0.40,          # 40% - Direct cost
        'latency': 0.25,       # 25% - Performance impact
        'credits': 0.20,       # 20% - Available discounts
        'availability': 0.15   # 15% - Resource availability
    }
    
    score = sum(
        weights[metric] * normalize(value)
        for metric, value in provider_metrics.items()
    )
    
    return score
```

### 4.2 Decision Factors

**Primary Factors (80% weight):**
- Hourly compute cost
- Storage cost
- Network egress cost
- Available credits/discounts

**Secondary Factors (20% weight):**
- Historical reliability
- Latency to users
- GPU availability
- Support quality

### 4.3 Optimization Frequency

- **Real-time monitoring:** Every 30 seconds
- **Decision evaluation:** Every 5 minutes
- **Recommendation generation:** When savings > $50/month
- **Implementation:** Based on policy approval

## 5. Reserved Capacity Strategy

### 5.1 Commitment Levels

| Commitment | Discount | Use Case | Risk |
|------------|----------|----------|------|
| On-Demand | 0% | Variable workloads | Low |
| 1-Year Reserved | 30-40% | Stable workloads | Medium |
| 3-Year Reserved | 50-60% | Core infrastructure | High |
| Spot Instances | 70-90% | Fault-tolerant jobs | Low |

### 5.2 Reserved Instance Portfolio

**Target Mix:**
- 40% Reserved Instances (baseline capacity)
- 40% On-Demand (flexibility)
- 20% Spot Instances (cost savings)

### 5.3 RI Management

- **Monthly Review:** Utilization analysis
- **Quarterly Adjustment:** Modify commitments
- **Marketplace:** Sell unused RIs
- **Convertible RIs:** For flexibility

---

## 6. Spot Instance Strategy

### 6.1 Spot-Eligible Workloads

**Ideal Candidates:**
- Batch processing jobs
- CI/CD pipelines
- Data analytics
- ML training
- Development environments

**Not Suitable:**
- Databases
- Real-time APIs
- Stateful services
- Customer-facing apps

### 6.2 Spot Implementation

```yaml
# Example spot configuration
spot_config:
  max_price: on_demand_price * 0.8  # 80% of on-demand
  fallback: on_demand               # Fallback to on-demand
  interruption_handling: graceful   # 2-minute warning
  diversification: 3_instance_types # Reduce interruption risk
```

### 6.3 Spot Savings Target

- **Target:** 60% cost reduction vs. on-demand
- **Minimum:** 50% cost reduction
- **Acceptable Interruption Rate:** < 5%

---

## 7. Cost Allocation & Chargeback

### 7.1 Tagging Strategy

**Required Tags:**
```hcl
tags = {
  CostCenter    = "engineering|product|marketing"
  Project       = "project-name"
  Environment   = "prod|staging|dev"
  Owner         = "team-name"
  ManagedBy     = "terraform|manual"
  AIOptimized   = "true|false"
}
```

### 7.2 Chargeback Model

**Monthly Allocation:**
```
Team Cost = Direct Resources + (Shared Resources × Usage %)

Where:
- Direct Resources: Team-tagged resources
- Shared Resources: Platform, networking, monitoring
- Usage %: Based on compute hours or requests
```

### 7.3 Showback Reports

**Monthly Reports Include:**
- Total spend by team
- Cost trends (MoM, YoY)
- Optimization opportunities
- Budget vs. actual
- Top 10 expensive resources

## 11. ROI Calculation

### 11.1 AI Engine ROI

```
Monthly Savings = Σ(Old Cost - New Cost) per service
Annual Savings = Monthly Savings × 12

AI Engine Cost:
