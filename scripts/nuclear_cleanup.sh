# AI Branches Emergency Cleanup Summary

**EMERGENCY CLEANUP PERFORMED**: $(date)
**Reason**: Excessive AI branch creation (1919+ branches)

## Cleanup Results
- **Started with**: $CURRENT_COUNT remote AI branches
- **Deleted**: $((CURRENT_COUNT - FINAL_COUNT)) branches
- **Kept**: $FINAL_COUNT most recent branches
- **Failed deletions**: $FAILED_COUNT branches

## Kept Branches (Most Recent)
$(echo "$KEEP_BRANCHES" | sed 's/^/- /')

## Emergency Actions Taken
1. **Disabled AI branch creation** in the engine
2. **Aggressive cleanup** of all old branches
3. **Preserved recent recommendations** for review
4. **Created consolidated branch** for audit trail

## Next Steps
1. **Review kept branches** for important changes
2. **Implement stricter branch limits** (max 5 branches)
3. **Re-enable AI engine** with proper controls
4. **Monitor branch creation** to prevent recurrence

## Prevention Measures
- AI engine now has **hard limit** of 5 branches maximum
- **Automatic cleanup** when limit exceeded
- **Branch age monitoring** (24-hour alerts)
- **Emergency disable** capability

---
*This emergency cleanup was necessary due to uncontrolled AI branch creation.*
*The AI engine has been temporarily disabled to prevent further branch creation.*
